    "GitHub is your code's home base. When you accept the assignment, GitHub creates a private copy "

    "Git tracks changes to your files. When you 'commit', you're saving a snapshot of your work. "
    "You'll write a short message each time to describe what you changed.\n\n"
    "To keep your repo up to date with the teacher's version, you'll use:\n"
    "    git pull --no-edit upstream main\n\n"
    "This command does three things:\n"
    "  • Connects to the teacher's repo (called 'upstream')\n"
    "  • Pulls in the latest changes from the main branch\n"
    "  • Merges them into your repo without asking for a commit message\n\n"
    "⚠️ Before running this command, you must commit your changes. If you haven't committed, Git won't let you pull — "
    "and you risk losing unsaved work.\n\n"
    "🔁 You'll use this command often:\n"
    "  • At the start of each new lab or assignment\n"
    "  • After your instructor announces updates\n"
    "  • Anytime you want to sync with the latest version\n\n"
    "Make it a habit:\n"
